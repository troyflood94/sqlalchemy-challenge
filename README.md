# sqlalchemy-challenge
Practicing use of SQL Queries in VSCode using SQLAlchemy
For this module we were tasked with demonstarting our understand of SQLalchemy and Flask.   

The work began in the "climate_starter" document.  We had to connect to SQLite database, and pull the column names usings .classes.keys.
We then found specific dates in the set as well as periods of time using sorting and datetime functions.
After that, we using Pandas to put everything into a dataframe and Matplotlib to display it into a bar chart, and added a table of summary statistics.

Stations used more quantitative functions in order to find the stations that are the most active. We had to count rows and then sort by that count in order to pick the most active ones. 
From there we broke it out into a few categories and got the min, max, and avg temperatures. 
We then queried to find a years data on temperature and plotted the reults using MatplotLib.

The flask challenge proved very difficult and I was able to get some motion on it, but ultimately the paths are not working and I cant quite figure out why.  I was able to connect to the localhost and create hyperlinks. However when clicked the hyperlinks did nothing on the page, the did however give feedback to my terminal in VSCode.  The notes are highly detailed in this one so I won't get specific on what I did on this README.
I was able to design an initial landing page, create a list of links, and, connect to it through Gitbash. I was not able to get the links to display properly when clicked in summary of this document.
